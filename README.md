## Project Setup
### Initial Setup
To set up the project for the first time, run the following commands:
```
$ bundle install
$ rails db:migrate
```
### Running the Project
To start the server on the default port (3000):
```
$ rails s
```
If you'd like to run the server on a different port (e.g., 3001), use:
```
$ rails s -p 3001
```
